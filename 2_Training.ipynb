    "\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** For the final model we chose the [Densenet 121](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf), an interesting architecture in which all convolutional layers are densely connected to one another (121 depth). Though image classification accuracy does **not** necessarily translate to good image captioning and performance on ImageNet does not necessarily translate to good performance of MSCOCO, the model is on the lower side of [parameters]() when compared to other architectures while also keeping a high [accuracy](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html) comparitively. We also use average pooling to reduce the number of parameters to the correct size before embedding.\n",
    "*[helpful to look up architectures- for names of layers and differences in sizes](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html)* <br><br>\n",
    "For the decoder we chose an LSTM with 2 layers as this gave the best results according to , with diminsishing returns typically standard after anything more than 3 and dropout of .75. These values apparently worked best according to [Learning CNN-LSTM Architectures for Image Caption Generation](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/msoh.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "TO DO:\n",
    "* encoder: try inception_v3 and ensembling\n",
    "* decoder: add attention (known to help in preserving information of location\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The original image is 256 x 256 pixels x 3 for each of RGB color channels. Our architecture takes 224x224x3, so we first randomly crop our image to fit this shape. Then the image is randonly flipped horizontally with 50% probability since this more than likely does not affect the caption; this may not be true for vertical flip or rotation which may change the caption of a bird flying *over* something. Finally the our pixel intensities are normalized with mean 0 and std 1 to control gradients; this is done for each of the 3 color channels based off mean and std values from ImageNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** For the CNN encoder, we choose to freeze all layers to speed up training, but tried freezing the first several layers also, as these in theory should learn high level abstractions such as edges. This is similar to the original [\"Show, Attend and Tell\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) paper though they used VGG instead. Inception V3 or any of the other models chosen are also most likely trained on significantly more data and therefore just need to be tweaked in the last few layers to adapt to our dataset. This also may reduce some overfitting. \n",
    "For our LSTM decoder, we make them trainable since we are using no prior knowledge. In later attempts we could try using pretrained word embeddings such as word2vec, fasttext, or glove. How having a large vocabulary would affect the output would be interesting to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Most papers seemed to used Stochastic Gradient Descent, with one saying the differences with Adam were marginal. We chose the former with hyperparameters straight out of [Attention-based Extraction of Structured\n",
    "Information from Street View Imagery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03549.pdf). Overfitting is a well known concern in regards to image captioning, so a small learning rate and momentum may help to alleviate that. We only train for a small number of epochs so seeing the impact may be more challenging."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
